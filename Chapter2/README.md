# Chapter 2: Statistical Learning

The lab in this chapter is an introduction to R, explaining the syntax and commands such as
`rnorm`, `plot`, `sqrt`, `matrix`, etc. Here we'll use NumPy to achieve the same result.

See https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/ for details of the Python Data Science stack used in the following code.


Key point: 
- ISLR stores the relevant data files in the ISLR R package.
