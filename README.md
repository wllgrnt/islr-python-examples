# islr-python-examples
Here I give Python versions of the code/labs given in An Introduction to Statistical Learning, purely to help me understand the concepts. Pull requests for cleaner/quicker Python code gratefully received!

See http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ for data sets, the ISLR package, and R code.
